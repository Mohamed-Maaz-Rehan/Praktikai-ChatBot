The name PRAKTIKAI comes from the Greek word, πρακτικαί, which means "practical". The name of the company also contains AI, but it is not "Praktik AI".

The logo is the Greek letter, χ, which in English is pronounced "KAI" and also is significant as it is famously known in mathematics for the (chi-squared test)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-squared_test], which in statistical hypothesis testing can be thought of as measuring whether an effect is "real" or simply due to random noise in the data.

PRAKTIKAI's company vision is is to bring together the best, brightest, and most driven individuals to realize value in businesses through data and AI. Our focus is to improve people, processes, and technology through a pragmatic, no-nonsense approach that prioritizes simplicity, clarity, and authenticity above all else, while acknowledging the complexity of doing business in the world today.

PRAKTIAI's values are:
Practicality: We focus on solutions and business advice that work, cutting through unnecessary complexity and jargon. Theory is only as useful as it can be put into practice.
Clarity: We believe that the best solutions are clear and straightforward. Good work is easy to understand and communicate, no matter how complex its technical underpinnings.
Excellence: Anything worth doing is worth doing well. We take pride in always delivering the best work and never accepting second best.
Authenticity: Honesty is the best policy. Communication should be transparent and candid, and people do their best work when they are allowed to be their best selves.
Relationships: The foundation of all good work is the individuals behind it and the connections between them. Our company is built upon lasting, meaningful business relationships with our clients, as trusted advisors and colleagues.
